Zm00001d034772	Encodes a close homolog of the Cauliflower OR (Orange) protein.  The function of OR is to induce the differentiation of proplastids or other noncolored plastids into chromoplasts for carotenoid accumulation.  Both proteins contain a Cysteine-rich zi /.../ger domain that is highly specific to DnaJ-like molecular chaperons.	[source:homolog]
